        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first year college student attending UC Riverside. I am majoring in Theater, Film and Digital Production, but I mainly want to focus on the film side of things. Ever since I was young I had a passion for the art industry and I always strived to improve the skills I currently had; the evolution of how I ended up majoring in film began with my intrest in drawing, that then began my animation journey. I took animation classes for all 4 years of Highschool and enjoyed every moment of it, animation was something that majorily intrested me; but after talking with my teacher he told me that with animation the majority of your day would be spent behind a desk. For me I tend to be more active, so sitting behind a desk was not the best option. I landed on film beacause I feel with my creative and hard working mindset I will be able to acomplish many goals; not only that, I feel that I am a great collabarator, and have a lot of leadership ecxperinces that would make me suitable for any position that comes my way.<br><br>

        While I have not had a lot of experince in the film industry, I also took production classes in Highschool and am currently taking some now. I am eager to begin learning what it takes to become a great artist and the process in which things work. I have worked on a few short films, and am currently working on a personal project with a couple people I've met since attedning the UCR campus. On top of this experince I plan on creating a new club for TFDP Majors with a good friend of mine that I met during orentation, we plan on making an inclusive club for all intrests in TFDP; such as Film, Theater, Writing, Casting, and others that we might add on over time. Creating this club will be a strenuous process for both her and I, but I believe with our strong mindsets and willingness to add value onto campus, this club will become one of the most strong and supportive clubs for anyone intrested in the arts.<br><br>

        As far as previous work experince goes, I have mainly worked in the customer service industry. At restraunts, fast food locations, and even a tutor for my local Middleschool, all of these postions have prepared me with a humbled mindset; these jobs have also prepared me for fast paced, heavy stress, quick thinking moments in what would be my daily requirments. I feel that overall my skill set that I've been working on for about 6 years now has developed to a point where I would be a great addition to any team that is looking for someone to help bring in new ideas.
